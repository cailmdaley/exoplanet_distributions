Fitting the synthetic radial velocity curves of a distribution planets; please see the [paper](misc/exo_project_paper.pdf) for an in-depth explanation. Some choice figures are displayed below.


![alt text](figures/fit_SNR=1.png)  
An example radial velocity curve showing the intrinsic lightcurve, the 'observed' data, and a fit to the data.

![alt text](figures/planets3_intrinsic.png)  
The synthetic intrinsic distribution, color-coded by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the best-ft model.

![alt text](figures/planets3_observed.png)  
The resulting 'observed' produced by fitting the lightcurves of all systems in the intrinsic distribution.

![alt text](figures/planets3_comparison.png)  
A histogram comparing the observed and intrinsic distribution.

![alt text](figures/planets3_correlations.png)  
A correlation plot showing the pairwise relationships between the true and fit values for $m$ and $a$. The dashed red line traces a one-to-one correspondence between the true value and the fit.
